# How to Talk to Developers

- Engage and grab the audience immediately.
- More important to be entertaining than informative
  - bored people don't learn
- Put most important information first, akin to newspaper article
- In talks: show don't tell
  - Slides are like photos
  - Live coding is like video
    - Creates more engaging content
- Body language
  - Arms bent at sides (90 degrees) are best
  - One hand in pocket not so bad
- People like stories
  - Especially if they're embarrassing
  - With devs, if it's code you wrote which is worse than theirs
- Power poses (2 mins)
  - Stand with hands on hips, or raised above head, or sit on chair with hands behind head and feet on desk
  - Brain adjusts and believes it
- Spot the nodder (person that's always nodding) to regain your confidence

  - People tired
- Don't give talks in big rooms
  - Better to have a crowd than empty seats
