# Monitoring the Health of your application

- We get paid to add business value, not to code
- We should measure biz value
  - Measure $ earned
  - Compare with historical data
  - Fire off alerts if benchmarks fall below certain thresholds
  - Example metrics
    - users that add items to a cart
    - # items added to cart
    - # items removed
    - # checkouts
  - If it's important to the biz, measure it
  - Performance is biz value
